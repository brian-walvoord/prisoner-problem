# prisoner-problem
This is a quick application for running simulations of the 100 prisoner problem solution.

The solution being used in this application is as follows: Each prisoner is allowed to open a number of boxes equal to half the total number of prisoners. Each prisoner will first open the box with their own number. If the number inside is not their number, they will go to the box with the same number of the number inside the most recently opened box. The prisoner continues this until either they find their number or they reach their limit of boxes to open. If every prisoner is successful in finding their number, they all go free. If even one does not, then they all have failed.
